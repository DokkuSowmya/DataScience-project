# Setting up and Starting a Django Web Development Project

# Install Django framework
pip install django

# Start a new Django project named "pricing_project"
django-admin startproject pricing_project

# Navigate to the project directory
cd pricing_project

# Run the Django development server
# Use this to check if the project setup is successful
python manage.py runserver

# Output: The server starts at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Access this link in your browser.
# If successful, you'll see Django's default welcome page.

# Apply migrations to set up the database for the first time
# Necessary to handle Django's default apps like admin, auth, etc.
python manage.py migrate

# Output: Messages indicating migration success, such as "Applying <migration_name>... OK."

# Create a new Django app named "menu"
# This app will handle the restaurant's menu and pricing functionality
python manage.py startapp menu

# Output: A new folder named "menu" is created in your project directory.

# Open the project in a text editor
# (Example for Visual Studio Code)
code .

# Add the "menu" app to the project settings'menu' to the INSTALLED_APPS list
# Example:
# INSTALLED_APPS = [
#     ...
# Open "pricing_project/settings.py" and add 
#     'menu',
# ]

# Make migrations for the "menu" app (if models are created)
python manage.py makemigrations

# Output: Displays new migration files created for the "menu" app.

# Apply the migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Output: Messages confirming that migrations were applied successfully.

# Run the development server to test the application
python manage.py runserver

# Output: Access your project at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to confirm it runs without errors.

# Quit the server (if running) using CTRL+C

# Install additional libraries for the project
# BeautifulSoup for web scraping, requests for API calls, pandas for data manipulation
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas

# Output: Installation success messages for each library.

# Create a new file for scraping and API logic
# Example: pricing_project/menu/scraping_and_api.py
# Add your scraping and data fetching code here
# Output: Print fetched data (e.g., menu items or weather conditions) for debugging.

# Train and save an ML model for pricing predictions
# Example: Create pricing_project/menu/ml_model.py and implement your model logic
# Include print statements to show model training status and accuracy.

# Ensure all required libraries for ML are installed
pip install scikit-learn

# Output: Installation success message for scikit-learn.

# Load the ML model in views.py and integrate with Django
# Add logic in "menu/views.py" to use the ML model for pricing predictions
# Output: Print predicted prices in the console for testing purposes.

# Update URLs to route to your application
# Open "pricing_project/urls.py" and include the "menu" app URLs
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('menu.urls')),
]

# Create the menu/urls.py file
# Add URL patterns specific to the "menu" app
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]

# Define a view in menu/views.py
# Example: Basic view to render a homepage template
def home(request):
    print("Home view accessed")  # Debugging output

    # Call ML model and scraping logic
    from .scraping_and_api import fetch_menu_data, fetch_weather_data
    from .ml_model import load_model, predict_prices

    # Fetch required data
    menu_data = fetch_menu_data()
    weather_data = fetch_weather_data()
    ml_model = load_model()

    # Predict prices based on fetched data
    predicted_prices = predict_prices(ml_model, menu_data, weather_data)
    print("Predicted Prices:", predicted_prices)  # Debugging output

    return render(request, 'menu/home.html', {'menu_data': menu_data, 'predicted_prices': predicted_prices})

# Create a template directory
# In "menu/templates/menu/", create a file named "home.html"
# Example content for home.html:
# <html>
# <head><title>Menu App</title></head>
# <body>
# <h1>Welcome to the Menu App!</h1>
# <h2>Menu and Predicted Prices</h2>
# <ul>
# {% for item, price in predicted_prices.items %}
# <li>{{ item }}: ${{ price }}</li>
# {% endfor %}
# </ul>
# </body>
# </html>

# Run the development server to see the changes
python manage.py runserver

# Output: Access the home page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and see the menu with predicted prices!

# Implement scraping logic in scraping_and_api.py
# Example functions:
# def fetch_menu_data():
#     # Scrape menu data from Yelp or other sources
#     print("Fetching menu data...")
#     return {"Dish 1": 10, "Dish 2": 12}

# def fetch_weather_data():
#     # Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap
#     print("Fetching weather data...")
#     return {"temperature": 35, "condition": "Rain"}

# Implement ML model logic in ml_model.py
# Example:
# def load_model():
#     # Load pre-trained model
#     print("Loading ML model...")
#     return trained_model

# def predict_prices(model, menu_data, weather_data):
#     # Predict prices based on menu and weather data
#     print("Predicting prices...")
#     return {item: price * 1.1 for item, price in menu_data.items()}  # Example logic

# Test scraping and ML integration by calling these functions in the home view.

# Final step: Deploy the Django application (optional for production)
# Use a cloud service like AWS, Azure, Heroku, or PythonAnywhere for deployment
# Steps for deployment will vary by service; for Heroku:

# 1. Install Heroku CLI and log in
#    https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

# 2. Create a requirements.txt file to list all dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# 3. Create a Procfile to specify the command to start the app
# Example content for Procfile:
# web: gunicorn pricing_project.wsgi:application

# 4. Install Gunicorn (production server for Python apps)
pip install gunicorn

# 5. Push the code to a Git repository and deploy to Heroku
#    heroku create <app-name>
#    git push heroku main

# Output: The app will be accessible at <app-name>.herokuapp.com
